# Capabilities

We provide a list of capabilities that agentic systems may have. The list is by no means exhaustive, but is meant to provide a first-cut for developers. The capabilities are structured in a hierarchical manner, to facilitate systematic identification of capabilities and risks. 

We start with four first-level categories of capabilities - Thinking, Generating, Searching, Executing. Broadly, Thinking and Generating are enabled by models, while Searching and Executing are enabled by tools. 

| Second-level    | Description                                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Reasoning](../risks/index.md#thinking-reasoning)        | Perform structured, multi-step cognitive processes that demonstrate deep understanding, problem-solving, and decision-making |
| [Planning](../risks/index.md#thinking-planning)         | Conceptualising a step-by-step plan that, if executed correctly, will result in successfully satisfying the user's instructions |
| [Delegating](../risks/index.md#thinking-delegating)       | Identifying the right agent to carry out a specific step in the plan, giving the correct instructions for executing it, and verifying the output to ensure it is correct and adheres to the overall plan |
| [Text](../risks/index.md#generating-text)             | Produces text outputs that are directly consumed by the user                                |
| [Audio](../risks/index.md#generating-audio)            | Produces audio outputs that are directly consumed by the user                               |
| [Images](../risks/index.md#generating-images)           | Produces image outputs that are directly consumed by the user                               |
| [Videos](../risks/index.md#generating-videos)           | Produces video outputs that are directly consumed by the user                               |
| [Web](../risks/index.md#searching-web)              | Looks for relevant publicly accessible websites on the Internet                             |
| [Files](../risks/index.md#searching-files)            | Looks for relevant files either on the local computer or within the system                  |
| [Databases](../risks/index.md#searching-databases)        | Looks for relevant information on databases it has access to                                |
| [Code](../risks/index.md#executing-code)             | Runs code and interprets the outputs from the code                                          |
| [Communications](../risks/index.md#executing-communications)   | Drafts and sends communications (e.g. emails, messages) to external parties                |
| [Files](../risks/index.md#executing-files)            | Modifies files either on the local computer or within the system                            |
| [Systems](../risks/index.md#executing-systems)          | Modifies the system's configuration, resources, or permissions                              |
| [Computer use](../risks/index.md#executing-computer-use)     | Interacts with the user's computer through video or screen capture                          |
| [Transactions](../risks/index.md#executing-transactions)     | Carries out an action that involves the exchange of goods, services, or funds between two or more parties |
