# Implementating the ARC Framework

A well-known adage in the Singapore civil service is "Policy is implementation and implementation is policy",[^1] and this is resoundingly true for AI governance. The ARC Framework aims to **bridge the gap between academic work on agentic AI safety and security with real-world governance considerations** by synthesising a systematic way to:

* Anticipate safety and security risks before they manifest
* Scale governance across diverse AI applications
* Maintain consistency while allowing innovation
* Focus human oversight on critical decisions
* Adapt to technological change without rebuilding governance

Here, we outline how two different parties, AI developers and governance teams, can apply the ARC Framework for their own use. 

* For **governance teams**, the ARC Framework provides a scalable and sustainable way to manage the immediate and emergent risks of agentic AI systems in their organisation. 
* For **AI developers**, the ARC Framework helps in identifying the relevant risks and controls to mitigate the safety and security risks for their agentic AI system.
